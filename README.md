# KeNIC Hackathon Project

This repository contains the full-stack solution developed for the KeNIC Hackathon, organized for Kenya Network Information Centre (KeNIC). The project aims to provide a modern, scalable platform for managing KeNIC's digital content, user access, and organizational workflows.

## Overview

The solution is composed of several interconnected applications and services:

### 1. Mobile Application

A cross-platform mobile app for users to access KeNIC services, events, news, policies, and more. The app provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with company content and features secure authentication.

### 2. Admin Portal

A web-based dashboard for KeNIC administrators to manage all company content, including events, news, policies, documents, and user roles. The portal includes advanced RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), audit logs, and content publishing workflows.

### 3. Gateway Service

A dedicated service for handling authentication and authorization across all platforms. It ensures secure access and manages user sessions, device tokens, and permissions.

### 4. CMS Backend

A robust backend built to store, manage, and serve all company data. It powers both the mobile app and admin portal, providing APIs for content, users, roles, permissions, and more.

### 5. LMS (Learning Management System)

An intended module for managing learning resources and training within KeNIC. This feature is currently **incomplete** and not yet available for production use.

### 6. Web Application

A web version of the mobile app, designed to provide similar features for desktop users. This module is also **incomplete** and under development.
